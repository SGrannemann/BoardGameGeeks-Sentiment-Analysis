# BoardGameGeeks-Sentiment-Analysis
Sentiment analysis on a set of reviews for boardgames from BoardGameGeeks via Kaggle.


Here I try out two different approaches to sentiment analysis: 
- a rule-based approach via VADER
- a ML based approach via Naive Bayes

This is closely based on Chapter 2.3 from the awesome "Natural Language Processing in Action" book by Lane, Howard and Hapke. 

The dataset used was downloaded from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/jvanelteren/boardgamegeek-reviews?select=bgg-15m-reviews.csv 

Many thanks to https://github.com/jvanelteren for providing the dataset!
